# Fox Labs

A WordPress theme. Started in 2024 as a hybrid theme to use with the WP Block Editor, but not as a full site editor.
Uses bootstrap, lightly and appropriately. Made with mostly custom SASS and vanilla JS, compiled by node with the help of webpack for the JS.

## Installation

* Using Node from the theme root folder: `wp-content/themes/foxlabs`
  * install sass: `npm i --save-dev sass`
  * install webpack: `npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin`
  * install bootstrap: `npm i --save bootstrap @popperjs/core`
  * install dependencies for bootstrap: `npm i --save-dev autoprefixer css-loader postcss-loader sass-loader style-loader`
